					<p>“If You Think Adventure Is Dangerous, Try Routine, It’s Lethal” – Paulo Coelho</p>

					<h2>Legacy</h2>
					<p>The first SKY DINING experience session in India was launched in August 2018, in the garden city of Rajkot. SKY DINING was conceived with the vision is to provide satisfaction to our Customers and our Employees and keep moving forward as a team. We are constantly committed to providing the highest quality of food, service and atmosphere to provide a fun, enjoyable, and rewarding experience to each and every customer.</p>

					<h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
					<p>We have chosen to provide people with exciting new experiences. As our founder say “We do what we love and we love what we do”</p>

					<h2>A bit about us more information</h2>
					<p>SEATING ARRANGEMENTS: A maximum of 22 guests can be seated around the table at any one time, but larger groups can be accommodated by dividing an event day into several lifting sessions, enabling more than 350 people to access this exceptional sky restaurant.</p>

					<h2>Restrooms</h2>
					<p>In just under a minute, platform can be lowered to the ground for quick and easy access to restrooms if provided. However, we do not recommend this, since it may cause annoyance to the other guests. PLATFORM CENTRAL WORK AREA: The table can operate with 4-5 personnel in the platform work area (e.g. chef, bartender, entertainer, speaker, waiter, security etc). COOLING: The organizer can offer extra options to set up a non-transparent roof to give shadow and/or to install AC-Fans or Misting Fans (to be pre-arranged at the resturant in the sky location)</p>

					<h2>Heating</h2>
					<p>Organizer can offer infra-red heating system as an extra option (to be pre-arranged at the restaurant location)</p>

					<h2>Minimum height and maximum weight</h2>
					<p>SKY DINING is not age-related but height related since we need to be able to secure everyone safely in their seats. Minimum height is therefore 135 cm and Maximum Weight is therefore 150Kgs.</p>
