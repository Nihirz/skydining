					<h1>Safety</h1>
					<span>SKY LOUNGE IS DESIGNED ACCORDING TO GERMAN NORM DIN 4112</span>

					<p>“The SKY DINING structure’s entire length is 9 meters, with a width of 5 meters. It is suspended on 16 metal wire ropes, 8 below and 8 above the roof. Each Rope has safe load capacity of 4 ton, which means a single rope can carry the whole structure. That enables a weight capacity 8 times the safe load capacity. That’s how seriously SKY DINING takes your safety.”</p>

					<p>“SKY DINING has been conceptualised and designed according to German norm EN 13814 and International Norm ISO 17842-1-2015. Platforms are built by the best team of engineers at SKY DINING. From the seat belts to the type of crane used, has been scrutinized and carefully considered to ensure maximum safety for the clients and employees.”</p>

					<p>“While seated you wear safety belts, standing presenter and crew are secured by safety harnesses all the time during the flight. A safety supervisor will brief you about all safety regulations prior to the flight and will be in constant communication with crane operator and ground crew so that he has a complete picture of the situation during the operation. “</p>

					<p>“The organising company gives painstaking attention to every detail in order to maximise security and ensure that you always feel safe.”</p>

									<h3>DESIGN SIMULATION</h3>
									<p>Our professional and top of the line engineers conducted the design analysis and simulation tests to verify and validate the intended functions, action, reactions of SKY DINING. The concept of SKY DINING has many structural possibilities but at the same time has to be extensively tested before putting into use because of various components like balancing, airspeed, its movement, weight management, movement of 27 people on the platform and many more. After careful analysis and multiple reviews from the experienced professors and engineers all over the world we got a finished, highly secured and a fail-proof model with details on each and every component.</p>

									<h3>FLAT BED TESTING</h3>
									<p>Our test beds are specially designed for non-destructive and destructive testing of steel wire ropes, synthetic ropes, chains, shackles, etc., according to DIN ISO 2307 and EN 12385. The forces generated during testing are contained within the structure of the frame. The specimen is mounted between the clevis and the carriage pin. Typical characteristics of test beds are robust design, ease of use, computer control, long cylinder stroke, electronic force and elongation measurement and the use of high-quality single components. With automatic data acquisition, storage and evaluation. The accuracy of our machines is higher than Class 1 EN ISO 7500-1:2004. They are easy to use and are manufactured according to the current European machinery directive 2006/42/EG.</p>
